# Welcome to Kleros Hub!

Resources for the Russian Orthodox Kleros and related projects.

## Usage

Browse current projects and musical resources.


## Roadmap

Digital resources can greatly assist the modern-day chanter, conductor, or hobbyist.

## Project philosophy

Printed books have served wonderfully for hundreds of years, but they do have shortcomings: 1) one must juggle many books during a service, 2) fragility of the book, 3) limitations of quantity or properties of book (like font size, typos, etc...)

## Contributing

### Running tests

The theme contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully. To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`. You'll need to run `script/bootstrap` once before the test script will work.
